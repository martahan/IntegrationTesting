# Continuous Integration for VyPR

The script test_latest.sh is meant to be placed on a remote machine and called over SSH.

The arguments are <github username> and <refresh>.  <github username> is used to decide from which repositories to take VyPRServer and SampleWebService from.  VyPR will always be taken from the pyvypr repository.
